        <div class="lh70">
            <p>Well... the US equity bull run continues.</p>
            <p>Markets keep shrugging off bad news, and the Dow had a mega day yesterday 🚀</p>
        </div>
        <p>But, I want to show you something else this morning...</p>
        <p>How I used ChatGPT to quickly model out a simple overnight trading strategy.</p>
        <div class="lh70">
            <p>After <span class="emp">another weekend gap up</span> on Monday.</p>
            <p>I was curious:</p>
        </div>
        <p class="fsi">"Which days are best for an overnight gap up?"</p>
        <div class="lh70">
            <p>I'm talking NYSE close to NYSE open.</p>
            <p>Simple structure: buy at the close, sell at the open.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>ENTER CHATGPT</h2>
        <div class="img50">
            <img src="./assets/images/The best overnight hold day-according to ChatGPT.jpg" alt="The best overnight hold day-according to ChatGPT.jpg">
        </div>
        <p>So I enrolled my analyst and backtesting expert Monsieur Chat GPT...</p>
        <p>Now, before you quant inclined traders whinge and moan and tell me "<span class="fsi">hmmmph that's not a proper backtest</span>"</p>
        <p>Relax, I'm not building a production algo here...</p>
        <p>I simply wanted to know <span class="emp">if there has been an edge in holding overnight, and if so, was there a specific day which stood out as the best?</span></p>
        <div class="lh70">
            <p>So, I uploaded a year of QQQ (Nasdaq ETF) daily data to ChatGPT.</p>
            <p>(Close and next-day open = easy gap calc).</p>
        </div>
        <p>First, I checked <span class="emp">weekend holds</span>.</p>
        <p>Decent...</p>
        <p>But, then I thought... "<span class="fsi">Let's test by weekday</span>."</p>
        <p>(<span class="fsi">image above</span>)</p>
        <p>This was a good start, Tuesday close to Wednesday open worked (ish)...</p>
        <ul class="non">
            <li>&#x2705; +0.12%</li>
            <li>&#x2705; 57.7% win rate.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>(<span class="fsi">For context, 0.12% is about $30 on the Nasdaq or 60pts on the DOW</span>)</p>
        <p>Ok, let's take it one step further...</p>
        <p>"<span class="fsi">What about buying Tuesday OPEN selling Wednesday OPEN</span>"</p>
        <div class="img25">
            <img src="./assets/images/The best overnight hold day-according to ChatGPT ii.jpg" alt="The best overnight hold day-according to ChatGPT ii.jpg">
        </div>
        <p>Na...</p>
        <p>So I switched it:</p>
        <p>"<span class="fsi">How about Tuesday close to Wednesday close</span>?"</p>
        <div class="img40">
            <img src="./assets/images/The best overnight hold day-according to ChatGPT iii.jpg" alt="The best overnight hold day-according to ChatGPT iii.jpg">
        </div>
        <p>That's better.</p>
        <p>Historically (well, a year) buying Tuesday's close and selling on Wednesday's close has had a <span class="emp">68% win rate</span> with an <span class="emp">average return of 0.43% ($105 on Nasdaq)</span></p>
        <p>So, I asked ChatGPT to plot the <span class="emp">equity curve</span> for both.</p>
        <ul class="non">
            <li>&#x1F4C9; <span class="emp bld">Blue line:</span> Tuesday close → Wednesday close</li>
            <li>&#x1F4C8; <span class="emp bld">Orange line:</span> Tuesday close → Wednesday open</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="img50">
            <img src="./assets/images/QQQ-Tuesday Close to Wednesday Open vs Close.jpg" alt="QQQ-Tuesday Close to Wednesday Open vs Close.jpg">
        </div>
        <p>Nice smooth slope for the close-to-close version, even if it was skewed by one big day.</p>
        <div class="lh70">
            <p class="emp">Takeaway?</p>
            <p>I'm not saying go all-in Tuesday night.</p>
        </div>
        <p>But...</p>
        <p class="emp bld">TradingView + ChatGPT = a powerful tool for theme testing.</p>
