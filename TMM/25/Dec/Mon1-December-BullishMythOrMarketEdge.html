            <p>We've got quite a light schedule of data this week, bar a few central bank speakers...</p>
            <p>So what does that mean for price action?</p>
            <p>Well, it's the first day of December, and if you'd believe the hype, that's typically a bullish month for stocks.</p>
            <p>But is it really?</p>
            <p>Let's look at the data...</p>
        </div>

            <h2>DECEMBER BULLS?</h2>
            <div class="img80">
                <img src="./assets/images/December Bulls.jpg" alt="December Bulls.jpg">
                <small>Hat tip to Michael Brown for this week ahead graphic. Give him <a href="https://x.com/MrMBrown" target="_blank">a follow on X</a></small>
            </div>
            <p>When you zoom out and look at the last ten Decembers for the S&P 500, here's what you get:</p>
            <div class="img50">
                <img src="./assets/images/The last 10 Decembers for the S&P 500.jpg" alt="The last 10 Decembers for the S&P 500.jpg">
            </div>
            <p>6 out of 10 years positive, with a few horrors in there too 😳</p>
            <p class="fsi">(I also backtested more years, 32 to be precise, and the data was similar, 59% of December's were bullish.)</p>
            <p>So yes, <span class="fsi">technically</span> bullish...</p>
            <p>But not exactly a slam-dunk seasonal tendency.</p>
            <p class="fsi">(And no, this isn't the Santa Rally, that's a different thing, technically strength in the second half of December... more on that in a week or so.)</p>
            <p>Anyway, as a reminder here's how December 2024 played out, week by week:</p>
            <ul class="non">
                <li>&#x1F4C8; Week 1 - Slightly up</li>
                <li>🥱 Week 2 - Range bound</li>
                <li>🐻 Week 3 - Bear party</li>
                <li>&#x1F4C9; Week 4 - Rallied then dumped</li>
            </ul>

            </div>
            <p>And so coming into the end of 2025 it's all about themes, right now it's:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>AI Infrastructure Boom - Big capex themes still running</li>
                <li>"Is it a bubble?" - The debate's heating up</li>
                <li>December Rate Cut - Odds now at 87%</li>
                <li>Trump Factor - "I'll keep stocks at record highs," he says</li>
                <li>JGBs on edge - Watching the Japanese bond market shake things up</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Not to mention the tariff battles with China and all the military stuff going on!</p>
            <p class="emp">Summary: The market will do what it wants...seasonality or not, if the participants are happy to hold risk, we'll move higher.</p>
            <p class="key">All we can do is show up, look for our setups, manage our risk, and stick to the process.</p>
            <p>That's real edge...</p>
