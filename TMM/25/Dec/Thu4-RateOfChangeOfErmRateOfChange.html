            <p>Heard of the '<span class="emp">Rate of Change</span>' indicator?</p>
            <p>Linda Raschke likes to use a 2-period ROC on her charts... here's a video where she explains it 👉🏻 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDg0VZFvFXU&t=1753s" target="_blank">Starts at 29:23</a>.</p>
            <p>And Stanley Druckenmiller once admitted (<span class="fsi">ha, 'admitted' like it's a sin!</span>) that charts help his trading decisions.</p>
            <p>But dig deeper, and he mentions something odd: "Second derivative <span class="emp">rate of change</span>" 🤷🏼‍♂️</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>RATE OF CHANGE</h2>
            <div class="img80">
                <img src="./assets/images/Rate of change.jpg" alt="Rate of change.jpg">
            </div>
            <p class="emp bld">Druckenmiller said this:</p>
            <p>"<span class="fsi">But I was introduced to all the top chart systems throughout 20 years, and we ended up buying a system, and bring it internally. And because it used <span class="emp">second derivative rate of change</span>, these things will often bottom a year to a year and a half before the fundamentals,</span>"</p>
            <p>Wait... <span class="emp">Second derivative of rate of change?</span></p>
            <div class="lh70">
                <p>Now I'm no mathematician, but I think that means... <span class="emp">the acceleration of the rate of change.</span></p>
                <p>A rate of change of the erm rate of change.</p>
            </div>
            <p>We know that Druckenmiller was looking for big macro themes, multi-year plays, and it seems that the 2nd derivative of ROC was his 'tell' before the crowd noticed.</p>
            <p>So, how much value does that have for us active traders? Probably not so much...</p>
            <p>Linda Raschke, however, looks to capture the next predictable swing... not a multi-week hold, but the next one to three-day move. (<span class="fsi">Far more useful for traders, swing or day</span>.)</p>
            <div class="lh70">
                <p>And she uses a <span class="emp">2-day ROC</span> to help find that swing.</p>
                <p>Then, a trendline break on the ROC indicator to guide entries. (See above)</p>
                <p>Just catching the rhythm of the market:</p>
            </div>
            <p>Trend → pause → breakout → swing.</p>
            <p>So, what's my point?</p>
            <p>Well, if two great traders like to use some form of rate of change, it might just be worth exploring how it could fit into your trading model.</p>
            <p>I mean, it does make sense, right?</p>
            <p>The markets do move in 2-3 day rhythms.</p>
            <div class="lh70">
                <p>We see it all the time... trend one day, then consolidate the next.</p>
                <p>Inside day then breakout.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Maybe Rate of Change gives us a clearer read on that cycle?</p>
            <p>Have a play with it, see what you think.</p>
