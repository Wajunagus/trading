        <p>Nvidia shares have soared about 1,000% since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. This includes a year-to-date gain of more than 40% that made Nvidia the first company to surpass $5 trillion in market value last month. That market heft means the stock's moves can sway equity indexes. Nvidia carries an 8% weight in the S&P 500 and a roughly 10% weight in the widely followed Nasdaq 100. Analysts on average expect the company to post a 53.8% year-over-year rise in third-quarter earnings per share, on revenue of $54.8 billion, according to LSEG.</p>
