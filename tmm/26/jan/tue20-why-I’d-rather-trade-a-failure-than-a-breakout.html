            <p>I've always believed there are two pillars to trading.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Screen time: The actual trading.</li>
                <li>And the homework: The studying, analysis, and journaling that most people rush or skip.</li>

            <p>Building on January's theme of creating your strategy playbook, we're going deep into failure and trap setups, the stuff that often matters more than the initial move itself…(and tbh, I generally prefer)</p>
            <p>Here's what we're covering:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Failed breakouts and failed trends as an opportunity</li>
                <li>Why failure often matters more than the initial move</li>
                <li>What failure reveals about positioning and order flow</li>
                <li>The psychological demands of trading traps</li>
                <li>The risk rules that matter most in failure-based trades</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I'll also walk through <span class="emp">seven specific trap setups</span>, with real chart examples, so you can visualise and hunt for them yourself.</p>
            <p>So if you like the idea of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clear triggers</li>
                <li>Obvious stops</li>
                <li>Waiting for confirmation</li>
                <li>And trading reaction rather than prediction</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This one's right up your street.</p>
            <div class="lh">
                <p>As always, bring questions.</p>
                <p>You've been firing some top questions the last few weeks, so I'm looking forward to more!</p>
            </div>
            <p><span class="fsi">Yes, including the Joker asking where the S&P is going to close today</span> 🤣</p>
            <p>Don't go wild today… Plenty of moves still to come this week.</p>
