            <p>So, that's another week nearly in the books...</p>
            <p>Barrelling towards Christmas at an ever-quicker pace!</p>
            <p>Soon, we'll be reflecting on the year gone by, cementing the lessons learnt and locking in for '26.</p>
            <p>But for now... let's go back a few decades.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>YOUR EDGE</h2>
            <div class="img50">
                <img src="./assets/images/Your Edge.jpg" alt="Your Edge.jpg">
            </div>
            <p>You remember the old-school pit traders, right?</p>
            <p>Bright jackets... shouting across the floor... somehow making million-dollar trades with just hand signals and a pencil.</p>
            <p>Those guys had a massive built-in edge.</p>
            <div class="lh70">
                <p>They could see who was trading, where the orders were stacked, and if someone walked in white as a sheet, trembling...</p>
                <p>Well, let's just say they were shorting the cr*p out of it before he could even start selling!</p>
            </div>
            <p class="key">Information + visibility = serious edge.</p>
            <p>And the best of them knew exactly what their edge was, and squeezed it for all it was worth. (<a href="https://tradersmastermind.com/floor-trader-smashing-size-into-bids/" target="_blank">Read my story and strategy from the days I used to listen to the pit audio</a>.)</p>
            <p>What they didn't do was start wandering off... trying new setups... or trading random products.</p>
            <p>They knew their edge and just did that....</p>
            <p>Today, of course, things are different.</p>
            <div class="lh70">
                <p>No barrier to entry.</p>
                <p>Trade what you want, when you want, in any size you want (margin permitting).</p>
                <p>Sounds great... or is it? 🤔</p>
            </div>
            <p>The real problem is this:</p>
            <p>When you can do everything, you get good at nothing.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Those pit traders paid a fortune for a CME seat.</li>
                <li>They weren't suddenly going to start trading IBM options on a whim.</li>
                <li>They were pot committed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And as modern traders, we should really follow that lead.</p>
            <p class="emp">Find your edge... and commit.</p>
            <p>Not sure what your edge is yet? That's okay.</p>
            <p>I just recorded a short podcast digging into this exact topic:</p>
            <a href="https://tradersmastermind.com/the-floor-trader-advantage/" target="_blank">The Floor Trader Advantage... and How to Build Your Modern Version of It</a>
            <p class="key">How to think about edge, where it comes from, and most importantly, how to find yours... with a little inspiration from the old pit traders.</p>
            <p>Worth a listen this weekend.</p>
